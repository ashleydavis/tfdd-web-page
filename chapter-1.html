            <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12">Gearing your process for continuous feedback</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In this chapter, you will learn:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>A philosophy for effective software development</li>
                <li>Why feedback matters when building software</li>
                <li>About the example application we'll be building in this book</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">This is a book about delivering software at a rapid pace. But it isn’t just about being a fast coder. By itself being able to write code quickly is not a worthy goal. It’s not even a useful goal.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-boutique-gold pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-gray-50 italic text-gray-700">
                <h6 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">As a <em>software developer</em> you must be able to produce code that is <em>working</em>, <em>reliable</em> and <em>valuable</em> in a reasonable time frame.</h6>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">If you can't write code that works, or if you can't write code that's valuable, there's little point being able to write code quickly. The real trick to moving at a rapid pace is to focus on the aspects of development that help you build your code the <em>right</em> way and indeed to make sure that it is the <em>right</em> code.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">When we create <em>broken</em> code (it’s so easy to do) we stifle our future progress.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">When we create <em>unreliable</em> code (again so easy), for example code that only runs on our computer but doesn’t work in production or doesn’t work on our customers’ devices, that’s code that by definition isn’t going to be useful.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">When we travel far writing code in the <em>wrong</em> direction, the work we have done is ultimately wasted (which so often happens).</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">How do we deliver code that is working, reliable and valuable as quickly as possible? You might have guessed already that the main answer is feedback. We need fast, almost immediate feedback, and we need it continuously through our development process. This book will help you build an effective development process to create working and valuable code, quickly. But we can't do that without building a solid foundation for fast and continuous feedback. In this chapter we start with a theoretical philosophy for software development based on continuous feedback, before spending multiple chapters learning how to put the theory into practice.</p>

            <h1 id="1-1-journey" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.1 A software developer’s journey</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Adopting a feedback-driven approach to creating software helps you achieve your goal of becoming a better developer, indeed a faster developer, one who consistently delivers working, reliable and valuable code, but we’ll do that in the right way.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Well, in truth, there is no single right way to do this and there are many wrong ways. We are all different and there are as many different ways to <em>do</em> software development as there are developers. But some ways work better than others.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We each learn in our own unique way and there is simply no <em>one size fits all</em> solution. Software development is too complicated for that and relies too much on situation, context, judgment and experience. There are many different ways to approach it that can work. There are many different ways to do it, some of which work for some teams but not for others. The thing that makes <em>you</em> a good software developer might very well be different to the thing that works for someone else. So please keep an open mind as you read this book. I’m certain many of the techniques herein will work for you, but there are sure to be some that don’t resonate and some that you will need to adapt to your own personal style.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">One thing I know for sure is that goals alone aren’t enough to achieve anything. Goals can’t be fulfilled without having the habits to back them up. Your habits will define you. Create good habits and you will become a consistently good developer. Create bad habits and … well, you get the idea.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">You already have the goal of improving yourself as a developer, but you still need some help creating the habits that push you toward that goal. Through this book you will learn principles, practices and techniques that will help you achieve your goals of delivering better and more useful software more quickly. We’ll be building these habits from chapter 2 where we’ll be working through this book's example of feedback-driven development.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">This book is for working developers who already know the basics of a programming language and are looking for pathways to a higher level of skill. To get the most of this book you should be able to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>Get the gist of simple JavaScript or TypeScript code examples</li>
                <li>Use the command line to create and change directories, run commands, etc.</li>
                <li>Use a text editor or IDE such Visual Studio Code</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">It will also help if you know the basics of using Git, but it’s not completely necessary because I’ll explain the commands we will use along the way.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">If you don’t know JavaScript or TypeScript you can still read this book, but you may need to put in extra effort to make sure you understand the code examples.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In this chapter we start with a lightweight theory of effective software development. After chapter one though we dispense with theory and get into the actual practice of software development supported by continuous feedback. Together we will build an application and you will spend most of the book experiencing the development process.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Generally, our goals are these:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>Create a rapid, but sustainable, pace of development</li>
                <li>Improve our probability of producing working code</li>
                <li>Increase the value of the code we write</li>
                <li>Improve our development cadence: the rate at which we produce code that is working, reliable and valuable.</li>
                <li>Use constant feedback to assess our work and make course corrections towards more effective development and a better product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">This book is accompanied by many working code examples for you to follow along with and a complete non-trivial example application called <em>Photosphere</em> (see figure 1.7 toward the end of this chapter to see how it will eventually look).</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">This doesn’t work without you trying it for yourself. Only by following along with the coding (starting in Chapter 2) can you really experience it. Then you must apply what you learn to your own development process. Take what works for you, adapt what you can and discard the rest. That’s a winning system that leads you to becoming a more seasoned software developer.</p>

            <h1 id="1-2-fastest-way" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.2 The fastest way to write code</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Before we really get into it, I have a question for you:</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-boutique-gold pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-gray-50 italic text-gray-700">
                <h6 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">What’s the fastest way to write code?</h6>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6"><em>HINT: We can be faster using AI, but that isn't the fastest way to write code.</em></p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Think about this question as you read this chapter. I’ll give you <em>my</em> answer soon. It might surprise you!</p>

            <h1 id="1-3-virtues" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.3 Virtues of effective development</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Producing reams of code quickly isn’t necessarily productive:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>When the code produced is unreliable and causes problems, it’s counter productive.</li>
                <li>When the code doesn’t meet the needs of the customer, your effort has been partially, and sometimes completely, wasted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Being able to write code quickly is only a very small part of it. And now that we are using AI the speed of writing code is even less important. As a professional developer it’s best if you can type quickly and without looking at the keyboard. Ongoing effort to <em>master</em> your programming language is time well spent. Being able to “think in code” really does help, but that takes a lot of practice and experience.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">You should be pleased to realize that being able to write code quickly was never particularly important for effective software development. Your code also has to work. It has to be reliable. But most importantly your code has to be valuable. If you know how to produce code that is working, reliable and valuable, even slowly, you will already be able to outperform many other developers, many of whom might be outpacing you - but only to produce code that doesn’t meet these criteria.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">A good development process encourages these virtues for our code:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>Working</li>
                <li>Reliable</li>
                <li>Valuable</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The key to building these virtues into our development practice is <em>feedback</em>:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>How do we know if our code works? We test it. That’s feedback.</li>
                <li>How do we know if our code is valuable and reliable? We should test it in production. We should test it on our customer device. Ultimately we should check in with our customer and ask them how it’s doing. Or better yet, watch our customers using our product. Again that’s feedback.</li>
                <li>How do we know our development process is effective at producing working, reliable and valuable code? We should assess this continuously during development. Yet more feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Many times in this book I will mention <em>our customer</em>. I believe that a <em>customer-focused</em> approach to software development is one of the best ways to ensure that we are committed to building the right thing in the right way - whatever that happens to mean for our given business, project, team or customer. For many of you reading this, <em>customer</em> will sound like the wrong term to use. So please mentally swap <em>customer</em> with whatever term you feel is the most appropriate proxy for you (e.g. boss, lead developer, product manager, colleagues, or end-user).</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Building good feedback loops into our development process is the best way to make constant course corrections to hone in on better code, better product and better process.</p>

            <h1 id="1-4-feedback-driven" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.4 Feedback-driven development</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">An effective development process is one that is frequently guided by feedback. You can see in figure 1.1 the two levels of feedback we are dealing with.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The first level is at the internal or personal level where we repeatedly complete personal iterations of work followed by testing and self-review. This is our tightest feedback loop and it directly influences the moment-to-moment direction of software development during our working day. The internal feedback loop operates at a fast pace, giving fast results that quickly feed back and influence the direction of our work.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The second level of feedback is at the external level, what you might think of as team-based feedback. This is where we submit our work for evaluation and review to our manager, colleagues and ultimately to our customer. The external level of feedback is necessary but it is much slower-paced.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">An important point I’d like to make is that if you are waiting for external feedback to know where to head next or to know how to improve, you will necessarily be moving at a slow pace due to the nature of this kind of feedback.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In this book we will focus on what I believe is the often overlooked potential for internal feedback loops to quickly and reliably improve our development workflow, help us deliver more valuable and more reliable software and ultimately, I hope, have more satisfaction in the work we are doing and the result we are delivering.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We can’t have a good development process without a good foundation. These are the principles on which we will build our development process:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">
                <li>Minimizing time to feedback</li>

            <h2 id="1-5-1-feedback-time" class="font-serif text-3xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12 scroll-mt-32">1.5.1 Minimizing time to feedback</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We must create a streamlined process for creating and testing our code. The faster we can see our code working the sooner we can test it from the point of view of the customer. Prioritizing fast feedback is the most reliable way to create a development process that can operate at a rapid pace.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We must look at our process with a critical eye. Our process should consist of techniques, tools and practices that support, empower and scale us. Elements of our process that slow us down or reduce our capacity should be jettisoned.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We aim to deliver working code at a fast pace in regular intervals, but we also need to make sure our process is sustainable. We need a routine that includes periods of rest so that we can maintain a rapid pace indefinitely.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">As a developer we aim to deliver a flow of useful code for our employer, our organization or our customer.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We should prioritize our work based on its value to our customers or users of our software. By value I simply mean solutions to problems for which other people or businesses are willing to pay and thus keep our business alive.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">But it’s not just the value of the code we need to consider, we must also balance the value of the code against the cost to build it.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">We should prioritize our work not just by how much it is worth, but also by how much we <em>estimate</em> it will cost to build. So code that is slightly valuable and takes a day to deliver can be a higher priority than code that is extremely valuable and takes a month to deliver.</p>
            
            <figure class="my-10">

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Development is a balancing act that requires not only thinking about how to code something, we must also understand the value of our code and how it fits into our team, our company and our product.</p>

            <h2 id="1-5-3-waste" class="font-serif text-3xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-12 scroll-mt-32">1.5.3 Minimizing wasted time</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Software developers are masters of wasting time. At least that’s what I’ve noticed from my own career, through increasing experience I turned an increasingly critical eye to the way I manage my work.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Of course, we don’t waste time on purpose, but the nature of the game is that there are an infinite variety of distractions vying to derail our productivity and we spend too much time on things that aren’t very important.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">You have probably experienced some of these yourself: automating things that don’t need to be automated; adopting tools and processes that slow us down; regularly creating bugs that take a lot of time to find and fix; wasting time on code and features that ultimately will be used infrequently; and often burning time trying to get unnecessary perfection from our code.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">To open ourselves to a more effective process, we should start with some honesty. Before we can reduce or eliminate the things that slow us down, we need to recognize and identify them. Once identified, waste should be ruthlessly eliminated from our development process.</p>

            <h1 id="1-6-philosophy" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.6 A philosophy for effective development</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">To create an effective development process, we need a guiding philosophy. Through this philosophy we’ll implement our development process:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-600 font-light mb-8">

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">A simple truth of software development is that <em>nothing gets created all at once</em>. Successful development is usually done through a series of increments, assembling the product piece-by-piece through an iterative and evolutionary process, getting feedback at each and every stage.</p>
            <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-boutique-gold pl-6 py-4 my-8 bg-gray-50 italic text-gray-700">

            </blockquote>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">By iterations I mean that we take a big complex task and we break it down into smaller and more easily managed pieces. This <em>divide and conquer</em> approach makes the whole job more attainable because we can see the milestones along the path. It also means we can test our code and get feedback bit by bit instead of doing <em>big bang</em> testing at the end.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Diving into coding before thinking is often a big mistake. This <em>code first, think later</em> way of working is prone to errors. Diving into coding without thinking often means we’ll spend time working on the wrong problem, chasing down the wrong bug or building a solution the wrong way.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Thinking through what we want to achieve, what to do next and how to do it - this is a kind of self-reflective feedback that helps us build a more effective process.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">It doesn’t really matter what technique we use as long as it gives us time for a block of intense work followed by a break. For my own personal work iterations I like to use the Pomodoro Technique. As illustrated in Figure 1.5 it gives us a cycle of iterations that are each 25 minutes long and have short breaks between them.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Complication, on the other hand, is quite different. While complexity is a fact of life, complications are usually unnecessary. Strive for simplicity while coding: prefer simple code and solutions over complicated ones.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Simple code is easier to understand and, most importantly, easier to test. And code that is easy to test is easier to <em>keep working</em>.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Although gathering external feedback might be out of our control, there are many ways we can generate feedback within our personal development workflow that are directly under our control, including developing through small iterations, self review and test driven development.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">The main problem is that code is expensive to create and maintain. Code creates baggage that we must bear going into the future. Choose carefully the code that you decide to write. Be cautious where you invest your time!

            <h1 id="1-9-ai" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.9 Can’t AI just do it all for me?</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Unfortunately, quite often the code produced by AIs is simply broken. They have no notion of what it means to write <em>working code</em> and they certainly don’t have the ability to test the code that they write for us. So we are left to test and fix the broken code that AIs create for us.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">At this present point, the ability to create working and reliable code is still a necessary skill for developers. Not to mention the debugging skills we need to identify and fix problems in the code the AI has given us.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">AIs also aren’t going to be able to identify the <em>value</em> in what we do. We simply shouldn’t want an AI to take responsibility for what’s important to us, our team mates, our businesses and our customers. That is the kind of thing that we should decide.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">So what’s changed with AI? Honestly not a lot. My work seems to move more quickly now that I’m not manually running around on the internet doing research. My trusty AI does a lot of that for me now. But they don’t change the fundamental skills that we as humans need to produce code that is working, reliable and valuable. Indeed, building working feedback loops and getting fast feedback is just as important as ever.</p>

            <h1 id="1-10-photosphere" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.10 The example app: <em>Photosphere</em></h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">While this first chapter has been theoretical, the rest of the book is mostly practical. You can follow along with the coding and together we’ll build a fullstack application while applying the philosophy of rapid development. There’ll be plenty of simple examples, but we are also working towards a non-trivial example application called <em>Photosphere</em>.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">Photosphere is a photo gallery and backup tool. Initially we’ll be able to upload photos through a web portal and then browse them in the gallery. Toward the end of the book, we’ll exploring building desktop and mobile applications from a shared codebase.</p>

            <h1 id="1-11-overview" class="font-serif text-4xl text-charcoal mb-6 mt-16 scroll-mt-32">1.11 Book overview</h1>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In the coming chapters we’ll implement our philosophy, create our development process and actually build the Photosphere application.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In chapters 2 and 3 we create a simple monolithic version of Photosphere as shown in figure 1.8. We’ll use this as a vehicle through which to explain the foundations of an effective development process.</p>
            
            <figure class="my-10">

            </figure>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">In chapter 8 we’ll take our first steps beyond fullstack and extend Photosphere with a desktop application implemented with Electron and a mobile application implemented with Capacitor. All frontends will share the same backend as illustrated in figure 1.9.</p>
